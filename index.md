# 👋 Hi, I'm Rajendramani

I’m a Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience in Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, DevOps, and Distributed Systems.

This site is my **public learning garden** — a place where I document everything I learn, practice, build, and experiment with.  
My long-term goals are to become a **Software Architect**, stay a **continuous learner**, and build a strong **technical knowledge base**.
